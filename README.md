# Quicksort with Rust
I've been wanting to dive into low level programming for a while. I'm quite familiar with C but I've been wanting to test out Rust for a while. I decided to try to make a quicksort algorithm since I'm familiar with the logic from numerous Python projects.

### What I learned:
* I am terrible at low level scripting.
* Rust is quite different from other languages.
* The features Rust grants are very nice, but not that big of a deal.

### What I will do in the future:
* A lot more lower level programming. Not only Rust, but also C and C++.
* Try to use less high level logic.
* Figure out pointers once and for all.
